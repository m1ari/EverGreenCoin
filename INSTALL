Building EverGreenCoin from Source Code

See doc/readme-qt.rst for instructions on building EverGreenCoin Qt ,
the intended-for-end-users, nice-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of EverGreenCoin.

See doc/build-*.txt for instructions on building eveergreencoind,
the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of EverGreenCoin.

There are bash jumpstart scripts in the root of this repo to build
on Ubuntu and Fedora. These can download and install dependencies,
download the latest EverGreenCoin source, compile, and launch
either the daemon or Qt EverGreenCoin software. Community members
are invited to contribute scripts for their own favorite OS.
