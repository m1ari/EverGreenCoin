#
# Prompts to build one of the following: An EverGreenCoin Daemon Command Line Interface (CLI, advanced) or an EverGreenCoin Core Graphical User Interface (GUI, easiest). 
# If your using a desktop or laptop, VM or otherwise, you most-likely will want the Graphical User Interface (EverGreenCoin-qt) and it's easier to use.
# If your using a VPS or server, you most-likely want a Command Line Interface (evergreencoind). This is more advanced to use.
#
# To open a shell terminal in Fedora desktop press "CTRL + ALT + F2" at the same time on your keyboard. 
# Input or copy and paste the following command line (excluding the "#" at the beginning) to get this bash script and execute it:
# bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EverGreenCoinDev/EverGreenCoin/master/build-fedora.sh)
#
# Or if you already have this file, execute "chmod +x build-fedora.sh" on the file to give it executable permissions. Then "./build-fedora.sh" to execute it.
#
# After this script exits, you can delete the ~/EverGreenCoin directory if you wish. The resulting binary is copied to /usr/local/bin and ~/.evergreencoin is created for the user, containing the irreplaceable wallet.dat file.
